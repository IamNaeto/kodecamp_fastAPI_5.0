Task 2: Secure Shopping Cart API with Admin Access

Goal: Create a FastAPI shopping API where only admins can add products, but all users can browse and shop.

Features:

User class with role (admin or customer)

Module auth.py to handle authentication & role checking

Endpoints:

POST /admin/add_product/ — admin only

GET /products/ — public

POST /cart/add/ — authenticated users only

Save data to products.json and cart.json

Use dependency injection for role-based access
