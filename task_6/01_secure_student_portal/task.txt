Task 1: Secure Student Portal API

Goal: Build a FastAPI API where students can log in to view their grades.

Features:

Student class with username, password (hashed), grades list

POST /register/ to register students (store in students.json)

POST /login/ to authenticate

GET /grades/ â€” requires authentication via HTTP Basic or OAuth2 dependency

Use try-except to handle file errors
